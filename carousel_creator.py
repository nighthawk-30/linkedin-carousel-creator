```
{{
  "slide1": "**Bold title statement**",
  "slide2": "Context setting, up to three short lines.",
  "slide3": {{"heading": "Opening line", "bullets": ["pt1", "pt2", "pt3"]}},
  "slide4": {{"heading": "Opening line", "bullets": ["pt1", "pt2", "pt3"]}},
  "slide5": {{"heading": "Opening line", "bullets": ["pt1", "pt2", "pt3"]}},
  "slide6": "Twisted loop closing call to action."
