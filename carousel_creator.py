Tone: {tone} â€“ {tone_context}

Create a LinkedIn carousel with up to 12 slides. Decide how many slides and bullet points each slide needs. Respond only in JSON using keys `slide1`, `slide2`, etc. Follow this structure:

```
{{
  "slide1": "**Bold title statement**",
  "slide2": "Context setting, up to three short lines.",
  "slide3": {{"heading": "Opening line", "bullets": ["pt1", "pt2"]}},
  ...,
  "slideN": "Twisted loop closing call to action."
}}
```

Use Markdown for emphasis but ensure the JSON is valid.
